Codewords Searcher v1.2

With my program, you can save hours of unnecessary code searching as it does the job for you. It allows you to search for specific words or phrases in various types of source code files, such as .php, .js, .html, .json, .ini, and .css files. The program provides an intuitive user interface built with Tkinter, where you can input the words you want to search for. It then recursively searches through the selected folder and its subfolders, reading the content of each code file and identifying the occurrences of the specified words using regular expressions.

The program utilizes color-coded logging to display its progress and results, making it easier to identify relevant information. When a word is found in a file, the program highlights it in yellow, allowing you to quickly locate the occurrences. The found results are presented in a visually appealing and organized format, showing the file paths and the corresponding words found.

Codewords Searcher v1.2 is a convenient tool for developers and programmers who want to efficiently search for specific code elements without the hassle of manually examining each file. Save time and effort with this user-friendly program and focus on your coding tasks with ease.
